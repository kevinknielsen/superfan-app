Goal: Invite new team members via email when they're added to a project.
‚úÖ Phase 1: Schema & Logic Preparation
1. Ensure your team_members table includes:
email (‚úì already exists)

name (‚úì already exists)

project_id (‚úì already exists)

‚úÖ Optional: Add a status column (pending, invited, accepted)

‚úÖ Optional: Add a token or invite_id column for secure login link tracking

üîÅ Phase 2: Trigger Email on Insert
Option A: Supabase Function or Edge Function
Use a Supabase Function or Webhook that runs on INSERT to team_members.

Example flow:

When a row is inserted with a new email, trigger a function:

Generate a login or invite link (e.g. /invite?project_id=xxx&email=yyy)

Send an email with that link

Update status to invited

ts
Copy
Edit
// Pseudocode
onNewTeamMemberInsert(async ({ email, projectId, name }) => {
  const loginLink = `https://yourapp.com/invite?project_id=${projectId}&email=${email}`
  await sendEmail({
    to: email,
    subject: `You're invited to join a project on Superfan`,
    body: `Hi ${name},\n\nYou've been added to a project. Click here to join:\n${loginLink}`,
  });
  await markAsInvited(email, projectId);
});
Option B: Polling from your Next.js App (simpler if no backend functions yet)
After project creation, loop through the added team members in your frontend code

For each member:

Call your /api/send-invite endpoint

Send the invite email from there

üíå Phase 3: Email Handling
Use a transactional email provider like:

Resend (easy with Next.js, modern API)

SendGrid / Postmark / Mailgun

Example in Resend (Next.js API route):

ts
Copy
Edit
import { resend } from '@/lib/resend'

export async function POST(req) {
  const { email, name, projectId } = await req.json()
  const link = `https://yourapp.com/invite?project_id=${projectId}&email=${email}`

  await resend.emails.send({
    to: email,
    subject: `${name}, you're invited to join a project on Superfan One`,
    html: `<p>Hey ${name},</p>
      <p>You‚Äôve been invited to collaborate on a new music project. Click the button below to join:</p>
      <a href="${link}" style="padding: 10px 20px; background: black; color: white;">Join Project</a>`,
  });

  return new Response('OK', { status: 200 });
}
üîê Phase 4: Auth + Redirection Flow
When the invitee clicks the email link:

App loads with /invite?project_id=...&email=...

Show the Privy login modal

After login, check if their email matches a row in team_members

Redirect them to /projects/:projectId

Optionally update their status to accepted

‚úÖ Final Touches
 Log all invite actions

 Allow resend from a dashboard (just call the same endpoint)

 (Optional) Show in-app pending invites for authenticated users
